#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - this run time is linear. If a = 0 it will only run for the amount of n.


b) This on is O(n^2). As n growth the number of interations also grow at the same rate.


c) This one is either O(n) or O(log n). I will go with O(log n) becuase typically recursive functions have this time complexity.

## Exercise II


For this problem I would use a binary search. I would go half of n floors and check if the egg breaks. If it does not break will go half way from where I am now to the top. If it does break I will go half way from where it broke to the bottom. I will repeat this process until I find the floor that it break on which has the floor right below it where it does not break.

This run time complexity is O(log n).
